    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This homemade margherita pizza is so easy and delicious! My biggest tip for this recipe is to use good-quality ingredients like fresh basil and sauce made with San Marzano tomatoes. Because the recipe is so simple, you'll really taste the difference.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can whole San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li>2 small garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>Cornmeal, for stretching the dough</li>
        <li>1 pound Pizza Dough, store-bought or homemade</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, torn or thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes, for sprinkling</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500°F.</li>
        <li>In a food processor, place the tomatoes and their juices, olive oil, garlic, and salt. Process until smooth.</li>
        <li>Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal. Place the pizza dough on the baking sheet and stretch it into a large oval.</li>
        <li>Spread a heaping ½ cup of the tomato sauce* evenly over the pizza dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. *Store leftover pizza sauce in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week, or freeze it for up to 3 months.</li>
        <li>Top with the mozzarella and transfer to the hot oven. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is browned.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and top with fresh basil and pinches of red pepper flakes. Drizzle with olive oil and serve.</li>
    </ol>
